# CP Portfolio Challenge 02

## Description

Developed a one-page portfolio to showcase my work history and examples of projects that have been completed. Code was created from scratch.

- ensure links in navigation scrolls to correct section
- work images open a link to a new page
- responsive behaviour for all sections

## Usage

File can be downloaded and used to gain inside into refactoring code and applying accessibility standards.
